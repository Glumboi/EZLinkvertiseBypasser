# EZLinkvertiseBypasser
An easy simple GUI app that lets you bypass linkvertise links.


# Info
I saw a github repo from Yenon (https://github.com/Enum0x539) that had a console app that bypasses Linkvertise links.
Then I thought making a GUI app out of it would be cool and thats basically what I've done, I did some minor tweaks to his code in order for it to work properly.
But the base remains the same.

If the first bypass ends up being blank, retry and it should work!
