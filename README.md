# EZLinkvertiseBypasser
An easy simple GUI app that lets you bypass linkvertise links.


# Info
I saw a github repo from Yenon (https://github.com/Enum0x539) that had a console app that bypasses Linkvertise links.
Then I thought making a GUI app out of it would be cool and thats basically what I've done, I did some minor tweaks to his code in order for it to work properly.
But the base remains the same.
